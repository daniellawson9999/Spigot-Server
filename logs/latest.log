[00:53:06] [Spigot Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: The server has stopped responding! This is (probably) not a Spigot bug.
[00:53:08] [Spigot Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: If you see a plugin in the Server thread dump below, then please report it to that author
[00:53:13] [Spigot Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: 	 *Especially* if it looks like HTTP or MySQL operations are occurring
[00:57:04] [Spigot Watchdog Thread/ERROR]: If you see a world save or edit, then it means you did far more than your server can handle at once
